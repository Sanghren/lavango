An attempt at implementing a bare bone VM in Rust for Avalanche, using the liner chain API.

This will -maybe- be a project participating in https://gitcoin.co/issue/ava-labs/open-defi-hackathon/3/100026354

## Objectives

My first objective with this is to have a simple VM that can communicate over gRpc with an AvalancheGo node.

My plan is to have a simple VM using lienar chain api that produce blocks on a fixed rate, allowing users to exchange 
native tokens.
